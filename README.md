CS330 Portfolio Reflection – Computational Graphics and Visualization

When I approach designing software, I usually start by breaking the problem into smaller parts and focusing on one objective at a time. For this project, my main priority was understanding how objects behave and interact within a 3D scene before worrying about visual details. Planning the layout and object behavior ahead of time helped keep the project organized and easier to adjust.

Working on this project helped me develop stronger design skills, especially when thinking spatially and considering how users experience movement and interaction in a 3D environment. I followed an iterative process, beginning with a simple scene and gradually refining object placement, lighting, and interactions as I tested different ideas.

When developing programs, I rely heavily on testing and iteration. Throughout the milestones, I made frequent small changes and tested them immediately to see their impact. This approach helped me gain confidence and improved my ability to debug and refine code. The skills I gained from computational graphics and visualization will be useful in future coursework and professional projects involving simulations, visual tools, or interactive applications.
